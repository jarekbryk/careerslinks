## Funding, placements, CVs, careers

This is a collection of links about sources of funding (placements and postgraduate) and career advice I have collected, mainly to be able to send students who ask me about this to this central place. I have tried to make it a bit more UK-centred than what is available on the web already. PRs welcome!

### Start here

These links should give you a good idea on what these resources are about.

–	[Dieter Lukas’ academic life and career thoughts](https://dieterlukas.github.io/academiccareer.html). Dieter Lukas is an old pal of mine and I like what he says :-)

–	[Dieter Lukas' massive lists of funding opportunities](http://dieterlukas.strikingly.com/), with focus on early-career researchers (scroll down to “Resources” section).

–	["Into Biology" list of placements and advice](http://intobiology.org.uk/summer-vacation-placements/), dedicated to undergraduates, UK-centered.

–	If you’re thinking of an academic research career with the goal of being a lecturer, **think again** - the academic research career has become an _alternative career_: most students do not become lecturers. Read the paper by [Taylor, J. Q. _et al._ Avoiding a lost generation of scientists. eLife 5, 1–5 (2016)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/17393) and this [report from the League of European Research Universities](http://www.ub.edu/portal/documents/34829/458399/LERU_AP17_tenure_track_final%5B1%5D.pdf/71d48297-0158-4785-bbcf-b2976575e769) on comparison of different academic career structures and opportunities in different European countries.

–	Always prepare for the fact that your next position may not be in academia: [a very good point of view from Michael Whitehead](https://michaelwhitehead.net/2019/12/18/the-resilient-postdoc-keep-the-exit-rows-clear-at-all-times/).

–	Interactive [academic research career flowchart](https://mrc.ukri.org/skills-careers/interactive-career-framework/#/home) which maps various grant application programmes from some (but not all) funding bodies in the UK. Also good for mapping several academic career pathways.

### Local resources at the University of Huddersfield

–	[University of Huddersfield's career office](https://students.hud.ac.uk/careers/mycareerplus/).

–	[The Huddersfield Undergraduate Programme](https://students.hud.ac.uk/careers/jobsandprofessionalexperience/workexperience/undergraduateinternships/).

–	[Bionow jobs](https://bionow.co.uk/jobs) "Bionow supports business growth, competitiveness and innovation within the biomedical and life science sectors across Northern England." University of Huddersfield is a member of this organisation and therefore has access to its regional (and beyond) job offers.

–	Annual HUBS Careers Day for biology and chemistry, typically in April.

–	Annual seminar on “How to be(come) an academic” run by [Dr Nathan Patmore](https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/nathan-patmore) from the Department of Chemistry (but applicable to all life sciences' students and highly recommended for the final year undergraduates and PhD students).

–	There is also a local (Kirklees-based) Tinker Fisher Awards scheme for summer placements' funding and an internal funding available to support travel expenses for undergraduates at the University of Huddersfield.

### General

–	["Into Biology" list of placements and advice](http://intobiology.org.uk/summer-vacation-placements/), dedicated to undergraduates, UK-centered.

–	[Dieter Lukas' massive lists of funding opportunities](http://dieterlukas.strikingly.com/), with focus on early-career researchers (scroll down to “Resources” section).

–	[Resources for undergraduates from the British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/learning-and-resources/career-development/).

–	[Advice on placements](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/careers/students/work-experience/index.aspx) resources at the University of Nottingham.

- [Austin Z. Henley's _Lessons from my PhD_](https://austinhenley.com/blog/lessonsfrommyphd.html). "Most of what I learned during my PhD had nothing to do with my dissertation topic, grad school, or even computer science. I've written down a few of the lessons in hopes that my students find them useful."

–	If you don't know what you could be doing with your degree, Researcher Development team at the University of Sheffield runs a great [weekly column with profiles of non-traditional careers of life scientists](https://thinkaheadsheffield.wordpress.com/tag/sheffvista/). (I note here again that "non-traditional career" name is misleding, as the vast majority of life science students do not end up being lecturers; the academic career is an _alternative career_ - see the Taylor _et al._ 2016 paper in eLife mentioned above ).

–	Richi De-Kayne, a PhD student in Bern, has [a blog in which he interviews PhD students](https://phdetails.blogspot.com/p/whats-phdetails-all-about.html) from all around the world. It's an excellent resource to figure out what PhD is, how to get there and what's next. Highly recommended.

–	Prospects Luminate has [several reports on the gradaute job market](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/tag/reports), particularly: [What do graduates do? Regional edition](https://luminate.prospects.ac.uk/what-do-graduates-do-regional-edition).

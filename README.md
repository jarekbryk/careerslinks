## Funding, placements, CVs, careers

This is a collection of links about sources of funding (placements and postgraduate) and  career advice I have collected to be able to send students who ask me about this to this central place. I tried to make it more UK-centred compared to what is available on the web already (very much US-centred). PRs welcome!

### If you overwhelmed by all this, start with these four:

–	[Dieter Lukas’ academic life and career thoughts](https://dieterlukas.github.io/academiccareer.html). Dieter Lukas is an old pal of mine and I like what he says :-) 

–	[Dieter Lukas](http://dieterlukas.strikingly.com/)' massive lists of funding opportunities, with focus on early-career researchers (scroll down to “Resources” section)

–	["Into Biology" list of placements and advice](http://intobiology.org.uk/summer-vacation-placements/), dedicated to undergraduates, UK-centered

–	If you’re thinking of an academic research career with the goal of being a lecturer, think again and prepare extensively and very carefully, because you will most likely fail: [Taylor, J. Q. et al. Avoiding a lost generation of scientists. eLife 5, 1–5 (2016)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/17393). Read this report as well: [2014 report on comparison of different academic careers structure and opportunities in different European countries.](http://www.ub.edu/portal/documents/34829/458399/LERU_AP17_tenure_track_final%5B1%5D.pdf/71d48297-0158-4785-bbcf-b2976575e769)

### General

–	["Into Biology" list of placements and advice](http://intobiology.org.uk/summer-vacation-placements/), dedicated to undergraduates, UK-centered

–	[Dieter Lukas](http://dieterlukas.strikingly.com/)' massive lists of funding opportunities, with focus on early-career researchers (scroll down to “Resources” section)

–	[Resources for undergraduates from the British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/learning-and-resources/career-development/undergraduates/)

–	If you don't know what you could be doing with your degree, Researcher Development team at the University of Sheffield runs a great [weekly column with profiles of non-traditional careers from life scientists](https://thinkaheadsheffield.wordpress.com/tag/sheffvista/). (I note here that "non-traditional career" name is misleding, as vast majority of life science students do not end up being lecturers; the academic career is _de facto_ an alternative career choice - see the Taylor _et al._ 2016 paper in eLife).

### Funding
